What is HQL?
HQL stands for Hibernate Query Language. It is a powerful object-oriented query language provided by Hibernate to perform database operations using the concepts of object-oriented programming rather than SQL. HQL is quite similar to SQL but operates on the domain model classes and their properties instead of database tables and columns.

HQL queries are independent of the underlying database and allow developers to write database-agnostic queries. Hibernate internally converts HQL queries into the appropriate SQL queries for the target database.

HQL supports various features like joins, projections, aggregations, and sorting, making it a flexible and expressive language for database querying within Hibernate-based applications.
