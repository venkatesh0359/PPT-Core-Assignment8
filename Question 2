What are the advantages of Hibernate over JDBC?


Hibernate offers several advantages over JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):

Abstraction from SQL: Hibernate abstracts the database access and query generation, so developers can work with Java objects directly, without writing raw SQL queries.

Automatic CRUD Operations: Hibernate provides automatic management of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, reducing boilerplate code.

Database Independence: Hibernate supports multiple database vendors, making it easier to switch databases without changing the application code.

Caching Mechanism: Hibernate supports various caching strategies, improving application performance by reducing database queries.

Object-Oriented Approach: Developers can work with familiar object-oriented concepts, making it easier to maintain and understand the code.

Transaction Management: Hibernate provides built-in transaction management support, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

Lazy Loading: Hibernate allows lazy loading of associations, fetching related data only when it is required, optimizing query performance.
