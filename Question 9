What is the difference between first level cache and second level cache?

The main differences between the first level cache and the second level cache in Hibernate are as follows:

Scope:

First Level Cache: It is associated with a specific Hibernate Session and is sometimes referred to as the Session cache. Each Session has its own first level cache, and the cached data is not shared among different Sessions.
Second Level Cache: It is shared across multiple Sessions within an application. Data stored in the second level cache can be accessed by different Sessions, making it more global in scope.
Lifetime:

First Level Cache: The first level cache is available as long as the Session is open. When the Session is closed, the cached data is also discarded.
Second Level Cache: The second level cache persists data beyond the scope of a single Session. It remains available as long as the application is running and can be used across different Sessions.
Concurrency:

First Level Cache: Since the first level cache is tied to a specific Session, it provides better data integrity and consistency in a multi-threaded environment, where each Session typically operates in its own thread.
Second Level Cache: As the second level cache is shared among multiple Sessions, it requires careful consideration for concurrency control to maintain data integrity in a multi-threaded or clustered environment.
Configuration:

First Level Cache: The first level cache is enabled by default and does not require specific configuration.
Second Level Cache: The second level cache is optional and must be explicitly configured in Hibernate using appropriate cache providers.
